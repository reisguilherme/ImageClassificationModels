# Image Classification Models
Diverse image classification architectures from Keras applications for brain tumor detection.

The 'EfficientNET,' 'ConvNeXt,' 'DenseNET,' 'MobileNET,' 'InceptionV3,' 'NASNET,' and 'Xception' models have been implemented to perform the classification of tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. A dataset comprising both tumor and non-tumor images was utilized, applying data augmentation techniques. The obtained results are presented below:
